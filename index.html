        <h3> Dear Grade 8... 

            What are some ways to say “No” to my partner? 
            
            — Not Ready </h3>
        </center>
    <p>
        Dear reader,

        <UL>There are so many ways to say no to your partener. The important part is that you communicate how you feel. 
        If you and your partener have a strong, healthy  bond, they will understand and respect your desires to do or not to do something.
        Be assertive. Be clear. But remember that your partener cares about you, and they will  hopefully honour all of your decisions. </UL>
        <UL>
        Something along the lines of "Hey, [partener], I'm not comforatble doing xxx with you. I hope you understand that it's just not 
        something I'd like to participate in right now. This doesn't necessarily have anything to do with you." </UL>

        <UL>All the best,</UL>

        <UL>Simone, Grade 8.</UL>

        <h3> Dear Grade 8... 

            Some of my friends are dating but I haven’t met anyone that I like. I’m only in Grade 8 and dating doesn’t interest me. Am I weird? 
            
            — No Interest
             </h3>
    </center>
    <p>
        Dear reader,

        <UL>You are absoluteley not weird! You have no obligation to be in a relationship or even want one. All students experience a desire to date
        at different times in their lives (and it's also ok to never experience it at all). Many students are just like you and don't want to be in
        a relationship yet. Middle school is an extremely awkward time, so I don't blame you. There's no rush to be in a relationship, you have the
        rest of  your life for that. As long as you're  happy and comfortable, everyone else's opinion is irrelevant. </UL>

        <UL>Be yourself!</UL>

        <UL>Simone, Grade 8.</UL>

        <h3> Dear Grade 8... 

            My friend and I like the same person. What should I do? 
            
            — Friendly Feud </h3>
        </center>
<p>
      Dear reader,

      <UL>I think it depends on the strength of your relationship with your friend versus your crush. Is this friend very important to you? 
      Would you want to lose them? How would your friend react if you wanted to date the crush? Ask your friend about the boundaries you have about the crush! For all you know, your friend
      may be wondering the same thing. But if they say they are not comfortable with either of you "making a move" on your crush, respect that! </UL>

      <UL>Now what if your crush is dear to you? This becomes difficult, because your friend <i>and</i> your crush are big parts of your life. It's crucial
      to <i>communicate</i> with your friend the feelings you have for your crush and maybe they'll understand. But ensure that you 
      are clear about your feelings towards your crush, because you don't want to lose a friend over it.</UL> 

      <UL>What's vital here is assesing what your values are in each relationship, and recognizing what you would be willing to sacrifice. Would you lose your best friend over 
      the dreamy crush you saw in the hall? Or is that just not worth it? It's tough, and if you ever need more help, ask someone you trust such as a parent, guardian or sibling. </UL> 

      <UL>I wish you well with your endeavors,</UL>

      <UL>Simone, Grade 8.</UL>

    <div class = "question">
        <center><h3>In what healthy ways can people show affection?</h3></center>
        <p> Everyone expresses and desires affection in  different ways. They can actually be split into different categories: 
            Words of affection, quality time, physical touch, acts of service and recieving gifts. It's important to figure out 
            the love lanuages of yourself and your partener/friend/family/anyone, so that both of you can feel happy and understood in  the  relationship. </p>
    </div>

    <div  class = "question">
        <center><h3> What are some unhealthy behaviours a person could display to someone they are interested in?</h3></center>
        <p> If your partener ever displays abusive behaviour towards you or someone else, even if their intentions are <i>to  help you</i> 
        that is not a healthy way to express affection. Being controlling and jealous are not things your relationship should have. I often
        hear of girls complaining about boys picking on them, only to hear "he probably likes you!" as a respone. This is one example of unhealthy 
        behaviour! We should not be normalizing diminishing displays of affection. Making someone feel uncomfortable, bad about themself, or even scared
        in a relationship of any kind, is unhealthy behaviour, and you should dicuss this topic in your relationships.   </p>
    </div>
    <div class  = "question">
        <center><h3>How could a grade 8 student have a difficult conversation with a friend, partner, or family member?  </h3></center>
        <p>You may have to have many difficult conversations over the course of your life, so it's vital to know how to properly communicate with the people you know.
            What you should remember is that no matter what the topic is, your views and beliefs are valid, and hopefully whoever you're talking to fully honours that. 
            So one major part of big conversations is being clear and assertive about your beliefs and situation. Be patient with the people in your life, as they may be  
            shocked at first, just give them time to be supportive of you. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class =  "question">
        <center><h3> What strategies can a grade 8 student use to be assertive in a difficult situation?  </h3></center>
        <p> Being  assertive means "being able to stand up for your own or other people's rights in a calm and positive way, without being either aggressive, or passively 
            accepting 'wrong'." So to be assertive, you should have a clear understanding of your personal goals and beliefs, so that you can confidently and positively express
            your feelings with people close to you. Be confident about what you're saying, because they are <i>your</i> feelings, which are extremely important!</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "question">
        <center><h3>Where can people get support for dealing with relationship questions?</h3></center>
        <p> If you have questions about any relationships in your life, including friendships, romantic relationships, and family relationships, you can talk to other people you trust.
            You can talk to a councellor if you need someone more professional, your family and close friends if you are comfortable, or there are <i>always</i> help lines if you need them.
            You don't need to figure  out  your questions alone, even if you feel alone. There are always people and sources that would like to help you, and I guarantee that someone else has
            experienced what you're going thorugh. At the end of the day, your happiness is very important, and even if you're just mentioning it to a friend, you can find answers to  your questions!</p>
